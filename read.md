The amount of data that is created and stored globally is just increasing every day. Storing such huge amounts is a problem which is the foundation behind Big Data. Big Data is a term that describes large volume of data, both structured and unstructured. Its importance does not revolve around how much data you have but what you do with it. Another emerging concept is Data Analysis which is the process of inspecting, transforming and modelling the available data in a form which can be better understood. In India, we often see people violating traﬃc rules such as jumping signals, not using safety gears, talking on the phone while driving, etc. With the ongoing digital transformation of India and the burgeoning concept of smart cities has enabled the authorities to issue a new concept of an E-challan to traﬃc violators. Huge data is collected about traﬃc violations and violators through such an E-challan system. Appropriate analysis of such data will lead to better traﬃc Management which will motivate disciplined traﬃc ethics. We hope that our contribution will help the traﬃc police to strategically plan the traﬃc and accordingly take actions for the safety and beneﬁt of citizens.
